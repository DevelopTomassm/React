# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# To implement firebase in your project
First log in to your firebase account or else create one.
Click here for create account(https://firebase.google.com/)

![node](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevelopTomassm/capturas-readme/main/LoginRegistroFirebase/FirebaseCreateAccount.JPG)

### Steps to follow
#### Create account or sigin in firebase
![node](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevelopTomassm/capturas-readme/main/LoginRegistroFirebase/FirebaseLogin.JPG)


#### Click on start to create a project
![node](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevelopTomassm/capturas-readme/main/LoginRegistroFirebase/FirebaseInit.JPG)


#### Once you are logged into firebase, create a project
![node](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevelopTomassm/capturas-readme/main/LoginRegistroFirebase/CreateProject.JPG)



#### Assign a name to the project, accept the conditions and click continue
![node](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevelopTomassm/capturas-readme/main/LoginRegistroFirebase/CreateP2.JPG)


#### Enable Google Analytics
![node](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevelopTomassm/capturas-readme/main/LoginRegistroFirebase/CreateP3.JPG)
This option is optional, you can choose if you are going to use google analytics or not, this can be configured later, we are going to enable it


#### Config Google Analytics
![node](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevelopTomassm/capturas-readme/main/LoginRegistroFirebase/CreateP4.JPG)

Here we will configure google analitycs, if it is the first time you have created a firebase project, you will have to create an account choosing the area you are in, if you have created more projects this step will not work


#### Connect Your Project With Firebase
![node](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevelopTomassm/capturas-readme/main/LoginRegistroFirebase/FirebaseConnect.JPG)

Here we will connect our application to firebase, we will have to choose if it will be a web application, android or ios, it can also be linked with unity and flutter


#### Register App
![node](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevelopTomassm/capturas-readme/main/LoginRegistroFirebase/RegistrarApp.JPG)

Here we will have to choose a name with which we will register our application

#### Add Firebase SDK
![node](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevelopTomassm/capturas-readme/main/LoginRegistroFirebase/Fconect.JPG)

Here we will have to copy the code fragment provided by firebase to implement it in our project and connect to our database


#### Autentication Users
![node](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevelopTomassm/capturas-readme/main/LoginRegistroFirebase/Autentication.JPG)

We go to User Authentication to enable users to be created so that they can log in to the application


#### Sigin Method Autentication User
![node](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevelopTomassm/capturas-readme/main/LoginRegistroFirebase/Auth.JPG)

Here we will choose the method by which users can authenticate, in our case we will use authentication with email and password and google


#### Enable Authentication With Email And Password
![node](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevelopTomassm/capturas-readme/main/LoginRegistroFirebase/EmailPass.JPG)

Here we enable users to be authenticated with email and password


#### Enable Authentication With Google
![node](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevelopTomassm/capturas-readme/main/LoginRegistroFirebase/Google.JPG)

Here we enable users to be authenticated with google
